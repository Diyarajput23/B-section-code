<html>
<p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML.Very simple markup for structuring documents, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and lists.,<br>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) has gone through several iterations since its creation, with each version bringing new capabilities and features to the web. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the major versions of HTML:<br>The first version, HTML 1.0, was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. It was very basic, focusing mainly on text and links, allowing people to create simple webpages with headings, paragraphs, and hyperlinks.

In HTML 2.0, released in 1995, HTML became more structured and standardized. It introduced new elements like forms, allowing users to interact with websites, and tables for organizing data.

By 1997, HTML 3.2 added more functionality, such as the ability to use tables for layout and to embed multimedia like images. This was also when web design started to move towards using CSS for styling, separating content from presentation.

HTML 4.01, released in 1999, made it clearer how HTML should be used. It pushed for separating content from presentation even further, encouraging the use of CSS for layout instead of HTML tags. HTML5, released in 2014, is a major update to the language used to create websites. It brought significant improvements to how websites are built and how they function. Unlike previous versions, HTML5 was designed with modern needs in mind, especially to support rich, interactive content and mobile devices.
